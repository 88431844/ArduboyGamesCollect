# Tetris-for-the-arduboy
A classic clone of tetris for the arduboy

So, its not quite finished yet. I need to do a few things more just to improve the look and feel of the game
I've always liked the song so i made sure that I included it.
I managed to fit almost all the oiginal features into the game!
The code is totally messy and shouldnt be looked at by anyone ever lol (totally joking, do what you want)
Contact me if you have any questions or comments! Id love to tell you all about the game!

-Russian music!  
-Blocks!  
-Scores + Multipliers!  
-Tetris!  
-Competition Map size (for all those nerds that that matters to lol)  

Controls:  
(make sure you flip the arduboy 90 degrees first, its a vertical layout game)  
UP : rotate piece  
LEFT/RIGHT : move to the left or right  
LEFT && RIGHT : Pause (A button to unpause (an accident tbh))  
DOWN : speed up the dropping time  
A BUTTON : show the next piece (Right side) and the piece in the bank (Left side)  
B BUTTON : trade a piece with the bank (for use later (you start with a square piece in the bank (by accident really)))  

To Do:  
-I'm going to comment the code all over  
-Adding better graphics here and there  
-mess around with getting better music if possible  
-Any suggestions?

I just made this game to pass time in class, so really, any comments will be totally appreciated. I need the practice!
Thanks so much for taking an interest in my code! Im sure you'll enjoy!
