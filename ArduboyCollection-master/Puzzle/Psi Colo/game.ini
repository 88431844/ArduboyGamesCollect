description=This is a puzzle game with dice on the 5x7 grid field. Creating a group of adjacent dice with identical pips - the size of which must be at least the number of pips - causes those dice to slowly sink into the field before disappearing. Chain reactions are possible by adding additional dice to a sinking set. Exceptionally, to get rid of 'one pip' die, you have to move a 'one pip' die next to some disappearing dice. Then all of the 'one pip' dice will start to disappear.
