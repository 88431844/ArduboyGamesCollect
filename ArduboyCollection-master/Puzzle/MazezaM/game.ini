description=MazezaM is a puzzle game that was created by Malcolm Tyrrell for the ZX Spectrum in 2002. The game was released under the GNU Public License (GPL) and has since been ported to approximately 30 different platforms including the Commodore 64, Super Nintendo, and Android under the (incorrect) name Rote. The game is similar to Sokoban since the player is able to push (and not pull) boxes. One difference is that the boxes can only be pushed horizontally, and any push causes all of the boxes in that particular row to be moved. Another difference is that the player is only trying to exit the level as opposed to putting the boxes in the correct locations.
