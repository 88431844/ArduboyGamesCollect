description=In a dying city, cut off from the world due to plague, the Tower stands above its center. While the rich and powerful gather in the tower, safe from the devastation below, those below are not so lucky. Among the trash on mud flats by the river, scavengers seek to find anything valuable. They are known as Mudlarks. This is the tale of one of the many unfortunate souls that lives Under the Tower.
