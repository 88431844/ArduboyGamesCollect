description=The Bounce is a bouncy ball physics platformer game. Simple to understand yet incredibly hard to master, what seems easy at first glance is actually pretty rage inducing when you get to the later levels. I'm not much of an artist so I focused on simple design, which allows for easily customisable levels (maybe a level editor someday) and awesome gameplay.
