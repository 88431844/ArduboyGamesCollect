description=The zoo had to close, but the keepers had forgotten to feed the animals, now it's up to Scrawf to find them food and feed them without being caught in the zoo warden's flashlights! Guide Scrawf through, what can only be described as, the world's most warden heavy zoo and hedge-maze. Slip past the wardens and avoid their flashlights to find the three different types of food to feed the Lion, Zebra, and Elephant. Finally, once all the animals are fed and sleepy, escape from the zoo!
