description=A version of the classic Apple ][ game Lode Runner. Your mission is to collect all of the gold pieces without being touched by a guard. Once all pieces are collected, make your way to the top of the screen and to the next level. To stop the guards, you can burn a hole in normal bricks to your left or right (with the A or B button) and they will fall in, revealing any gold they might have picked up along the way.
