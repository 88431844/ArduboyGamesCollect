description=Who's brave enough to play chicken with a train? Stand on the track as multiple trains come at you full-speed... The closer they get to you before jumping off the tracks, the more points you'll rack up. (You'll also lose points for jumping off of the track too early.) Dodge as many as you can, but beware! If you don't jump off in time, you'll be hit!
