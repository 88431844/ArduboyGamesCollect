## Important!

**After uploading Arduventure to your Arduboy you won't be able to upload another game using the normal process.**

**If you want to put a new game on your Arduboy with Arduventure, you must follow these steps:**

1. Plug in your Arduboy to the PC you will use for reprogramming
2. Turn on the Arduboy and from the main menu of Arduventure select “UPLOAD”
3. When the on screen instructions appear, press and continue to hold the _down_ button. (This will place the Arduboy in bootloader mode, ready to be reprogrammed)
4. While continuing to hold the _down_ button, press the upload button from your PC
5. When the upload completes, let go of the _down_ button and after a short delay the new game will start
