# MicroCity

![Demo](Images/demo.gif)

MicroCity is a city simulation game for the [Arduboy miniature game system](https://www.arduboy.com) inspired by SimCity

## Build instructions
To compile from source you will need the [Arduboy2 library](https://github.com/MLXXXp/Arduboy2) and the Arduino IDE

Open /Source/MicroCity/MicroCity.ino in the Arduino IDE and hit build

## Flashing other games
Note that there is a bug with the Arduboy bootloader when flashing new games. If flashing a new Arduino sketch after having previously flashing MicroCity, then first boot the Arduboy into *flashlight mode* by holding the up button whilst switching on the device.
